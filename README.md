# AES6 Wow and Flutter Analysis Tool

**Python implementation for calculating and analyzing Wow & Flutter (W&F) in audio recordings according to the AES6-2008 standard** (compatible with IEC/DIN variants). This tool follows the preferred *Two Sigma* method, as described in the document:

üìÑ [Wow and Flutter Measurement using Multi-Instrument](https://www.virtins.com/doc/Wow-and-Flutter-Measurement-using-Multi-Instrument.pdf)

This script was created for educational purposes, in the absence of publicly available code implementing precise W&F measurements as defined by international standards.

## üöÄ Quick Start

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you're only interested in using the tool (without diving into the technical details), you can download the standalone Windows executable from the `dist/` folder. No Python environment required.**

## üìÇ Files and Structure

- `wnf_meter.py`: Main script that performs Wow & Flutter analysis in **7 clear steps**, outputting both *unweighted* and *weighted* 2œÉ (Two Sigma) results.
- `weighting_filter.py`: Generates the IIR filter coefficients that implement the **AES6 weighting curve**, designed as a simple asymmetric bandpass filter.
- `weighting_filter_a.csv`, `weighting_filter_b.csv`: Coefficients used to apply the weighting filter in the analysis script.
- `assets/`: Contains sample reference audio files for testing, including synthetic modulated tones and a test signal captured from a Reloop RP-4000MK2 turntable.

## üìä Reference Results

The following table compares the **theoretical weighted W&F values** for the synthetic test files (as defined in the Virtins guide) with the **measured values** obtained using this tool:

## üéõÔ∏è Weighting Filter Design

The `weighting_filter.py` script implements a straightforward analog-inspired design using bilinear-transformed high-pass and low-pass stages, resulting in an IIR bandpass filter that conforms to the tolerance envelope defined in AES6. The filter is designed to operate at a **sample rate of 2 kHz**, which is sufficient for the frequency range of interest in W&F analysis (typically <200 Hz).

Users can extend this script to design and validate more complex filters using the same framework.
